# TinyMPC - Accelerated and Compressed Model-Predictive Control

TinyMPC is an optimization solver designed for convex model-predictive control, 
offering impressive speed and a minimal memory footprint. 
Implemented in pure C++, it carries the Apache-2.0 license and can be compiled into a library with a minimal footprint, 
making it particularly well-suited for embedded solvers in control and robotics applications. 
Additionally, TinyMPC provides interactive interfaces for seamless integration with high-level languages such as Python, Julia, and Matlab.
