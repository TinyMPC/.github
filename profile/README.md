# TinyMPC - Accelerated and Compressed Model-Predictive Control

TinyMPC is an optimization solver designed for convex model-predictive control, 
offering high speed and a minimal memory footprint. 
Implemented in pure C/C++, it carries the MIT license and can be compiled into an embedded solver,
making it particularly well-suited for control and robotics applications. 
Additionally, TinyMPC provides interactive interfaces for seamless integration with high-level languages such as Python, Julia, and Matlab.

[**Visit the documentation**](https://tinympc.org/docs/) to learn how to use TinyMPC.

[**Visit our GitHub Discussions page**](https://github.com/TinyMPC/discussions) for any questions related to the solver!

If you use TinyMPC in an academic work, please cite the relevant [papers](https://tinympc.org/docs/citing/).
